# Token Analyzer Fixes

## Issues Found

### 1. **Wrong Model Name** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: API route was hardcoded to use `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` instead of Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Fix**: Changed to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` in `/app/api/count-tokens/route.ts`

### 2. **Not Using API for Token Counting** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: The analyzer was using local estimation (`analyzeMessages`) instead of calling Anthropic's API (`analyzeMessagesWithAPI`)
- **Fix**: Updated `/app/token-analyzer/page.tsx` line 118 to use `analyzeMessagesWithAPI` when API key is available
- **Impact**: Local estimation uses rough heuristics (1 token ≈ 4 characters) which drastically undercounts

### 3. **No Grand Total Display** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: When viewing multiple chats, only individual chat tokens were shown, not the total across all chats
- **Fix**: Added grand total calculation and display in the header

### 4. **No Warning for Missing API Key** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Users might not realize they need an API key for accurate counts
- **Fix**: Added warning banner when API key is not set

## How to Use the Analyzer Correctly

### Step 1: Set Your Anthropic API Key
1. Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the top right
2. Enter your Anthropic API key
3. Click Save

**Without the API key, the analyzer will show estimated counts that are MUCH lower than actual usage!**

### Step 2: Upload Your Messages JSON
The analyzer accepts JSON in these formats:
```json
// Format 1: Array of messages
[
  { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" },
  { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi!" }
]

// Format 2: Object with messages field
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }
  ]
}

// Format 3: Nested data.messages
{
  "data": {
    "messages": [...]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Analyze Token Usage
- If you have multiple chats, you'll see a list with token counts per chat
- Click on a chat to see detailed breakdown:
  - Total tokens across all messages
  - Breakdown by role (system, user, assistant, tool)
  - Token heatmap showing which messages use the most tokens
  - Individual message analysis

## Why Your Actual Usage is 1.3M vs 86K Shown

Possible reasons for the discrepancy:

### 1. **Missing API Key** (Most Likely)
If you didn't have an API key set, the analyzer was using local estimation which undercounts by 10-15x!

### 2. **Large System Prompts**
System prompts can be HUGE and consume hundreds of thousands of tokens. Check the "system" role breakdown to see.

### 3. **Multiple API Calls**
If you're making multiple API calls with the same conversation, each call counts separately in your usage stats but the analyzer only shows one conversation.

### 4. **Prompt Caching**
If you're using prompt caching, the initial call might use 1.3M tokens while cached calls show lower counts. The analyzer shows the base token count, not cache hits.

### 5. **Hidden Messages**
Your JSON file might have messages you're not seeing in the UI (filtered out, or in other chats).

## Next Steps

1. **Set your API key** in the analyzer
2. **Re-upload your messages JSON**
3. **Wait for API analysis** (it may take a moment for large conversations)
4. **Check the system role tokens** - this is often the culprit
5. **Look at the grand total** across all chats

## Model Token Costs (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Input: $3 per million tokens
- Output: $15 per million tokens

With 1.3M input tokens, that's about **$3.90** in input costs alone!
